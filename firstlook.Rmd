# R Markdown

## First Sub-heading

### First sub-sub-heading

This is how you **bold** words, and _italicize_ things.

This is how you create lists:

* My name is Caleb
* I don't know if I really like Marie or not
* I may just not be over Allie yet

Here is an equation:

$$  f(x)=x^2  $$

## Embedding R Code:

```{r normal_hist, echo=FALSE}
# Simulate 100 normal random variables

x <- rnorm(100)

hist(x)

```

```{r read_data}

dat <- read.csv("data/inflammation-01.csv", header = FALSE)

```

```{r plot_analysis}
avg_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, mean)
plot(avg_day_inflammation, 
     xlab = "Day",
     ylab = "Inflammation",
     main = "Average Daily Inflammation")
```
